## Learning management system
 A learning management system (LMS) is a software application for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting, automation, and delivery of educational courses, training programs, materials or learning and development programs.[1] The learning management system concept emerged directly from e-Learning. Learning management systems make up the largest segment of the learning system market. The first introduction of the LMS was in the late 1990s.[2] Learning management systems have faced a massive growth in usage due to the emphasis on remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.[3]

Learning management systems were designed to identify training and learning gaps, using analytical data and reporting. LMSs are focused on online learning delivery but support a range of uses, acting as a platform for online content, including courses, both asynchronous based and synchronous based. In the higher education space, an LMS may offer classroom management for instructor-led training or a flipped classroom.[4] Modern LMSs include intelligent algorithms to make automated recommendations for courses based on a user's skill profile as well as extract metadata from learning materials to make such recommendations even more accurate.

## Characteristics
### Purpose
An LMS delivers and manages all types of content, including video, courses, workshops, and documents. In the education and higher education markets, an LMS will include a variety of functionality that is similar to corporate but will have features such as rubrics, teacher and instructor-facilitated learning, a discussion board, and often the use of a syllabus. A syllabus is rarely a feature in the corporate LMS, although courses may start with heading-level index to give learners an overview of topics covered. 
### History
There are several historical phases of distance education that preceded the development of the LMS:

The first LMS was created in 1924 when Sidney Pressey invented the first ‘teaching machine’. This machine similar to a type writer with the window showing the questions. From then on continuous technological development has contributed to vast changes to LMS with the latest update in 2012 where the LMS is hosted in a cloud, hence freeing companies from the burden of maintaining in-house systems.
